# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Sohitha Kommineni

## About Me
Most people see rows and columns. I see **signals, blind spots, and untapped opportunities** waiting to be uncovered. For me, data isnâ€™t just about analysis â€” itâ€™s about building systems that **change the speed and quality of decisions.**  

Iâ€™ve built dashboards that executives treat as their daily compass, automated workflows that replaced hours of manual effort, and risk monitors that caught problems before they surfaced. My work is where **clarity meets impact** â€” transforming complexity into insights that are trusted, actionable, and impossible to ignore.  

I donâ€™t just process data. I design **decision tools** â€” tools that give leaders confidence, teams direction, and organizations measurable outcomes.
